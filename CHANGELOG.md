# CHANGELOG

## 2026-04-19 18:22 EEST — v0.3.0
- Performed safe inclusion and validation pass across the incoming frontend bundle and the audited system-documentation bundle.
- Kept the stronger modular frontend from the incoming project, including separate view files for A, B, C, and D, shared runtime-truth mock state, generated test data, and the Vite-based package setup.
- Included the stronger audited system documents `00_TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` through `14_VERSIONING_AND_CHANGELOG_RULES.md`.
- Preserved the frontend view documentation files because they remained consistent with the current UI surface and did not contradict the stronger system documents.
- Added `vite.config.js` so `npm run dev` works from the repository root while keeping the frontend files under `dashboard/`.
- Updated top-level README and documentation control text to clarify precedence between system documents and frontend view documents.

## 2026-04-20 19:00 EEST — v0.3.1
- Added the central `docs/issues_errors_discrepancies.md` registry and recorded the first verified HIGH issues.
- Fixed overlapping B3 pipeline stage execution in the frontend runtime-truth layer by enforcing a shared pipeline lock and sequential auto-stage execution.
- Fixed duplicate B4 playback and real-run start behavior by adding single-instance guards and idempotent start handling.

## 2026-04-20 19:16 EEST — v0.3.2
- Fixed B5 screen simulation so toggle and timeout changes now drive shared screen/playback truth and the B4 preview state.
- Added re-entrant action guards for generic control actions and the B1 login flow to prevent overlapping timers and duplicate UI runs.
- Recorded and verified ISSUE-0003 and ISSUE-0004 in the central issues registry.
